She is the current empress, known as the "Snake Princess", of Amazon Lily and rules over the Kuja tribe with her two younger Gorgon sisters, Boa Sandersonia and Boa Marigold. She was first mentioned by the Risky Brothers at the end of the Thriller Bark Arc when comparing her legendary beauty to the beauty of mermaids. She is the main antagonist of the Amazon Lily Arc, before befriending and falling in love with Monkey D. Luffy in the same arc and eventually pledged both her love and loyalty to him after she understood the story behind how he punched a Celestial Dragon and heard his declaration that he only despises the World Nobles, and not her who had to suffer through their egregious actions, leading to her becoming one of his most stalwart allies. She becomes his ally during the rest of the Summit War Saga, as well as the Return to Sabaody Arc. She also acts as an ally of Luffy during the 3D2Y special, the Cidre Guild filler Arc, and the movie One Piece: Stampede. While she used to be employed within the Seven Warlords, her love for Monkey D. Luffy has caused her to turn against the World Government on a number of occasions, thus putting her status as a Warlord in jeopardy. It was not until the most recent Levely where the Warlords were officially abolished due to the exposed nefarious actions of Crocodile and Doflamingo towards the other monarchs, causing her to lose her status as a warlord as well.', true, true, false, null, 'https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/51158316-fd7e-48ca-b5fe-8542e9dfe357/dbcd4ed-b80e9027-edaf-45c0-825c-41b58033981b.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzUxMTU4MzE2LWZkN2UtNDhjYS1iNWZlLTg1NDJlOWRmZTM1N1wvZGJjZDRlZC1iODBlOTAyNy1lZGFmLTQ1YzAtODI1Yy00MWI1ODAzMzk4MWIucG5nIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.XqC5I8I-J07U5NNm-I4GUyVTExnpUQsU1n9qn516Ync', 31, 44, null),
